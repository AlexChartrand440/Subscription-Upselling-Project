# Subscription Upselling Project
<b>CONTEXT</b><br>
An anonymized magazine publisher's marketing team is looking for ways to see if they can upsell to their existing customer. From Customer Relationship Management perspective, <i>"Finding a new customer costs 5x as much as keeping an old customer."</i> Thus, it is important that they understand the characteristics of their targeted customers. 
<br><br>
<b>OBJECTIVE</b><br>
To understand the characteristics of customers who subscribe more than one magazine compared to customers only subscribing to one magazine. 
<br><br>
<b>DATA DESCRIPTION</b><br>
The only raw data provided is in CustSubscriptions.csv file. This file consists of data of 16,020 customers and various characteristics describing their demographic or behavior such as: age, gender, household income, years as customer, number of subscriptions, and total revenue. This data set does not specify over what time period is total revenue earned, so it is assumed that total revenue is the figure of yearly total revenue collected based on the year prior to when analysis is made.
